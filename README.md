# Raspberry Pi WiFi Bridge
A high-availability WiFi-to-Ethernet bridge solution using two Raspberry Pi 3B+ units with automatic failover.

## Features
- **High Availability**: Redundant bridge configuration with automatic failover
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive connectivity and performance monitoring
- **Security Hardened**: Firewall rules and SSH hardening included
- **Performance Optimized**: QoS traffic shaping and network optimizations
- **Automated Setup**: Complete installation and configuration scripts
- **Monitoring Integration**: ELK stack integration for centralized logging

## Quick Start
1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite on two microSD cards
2. Clone this repository to `/home/pi/` on both Pi units
3. Run setup on primary Pi:
